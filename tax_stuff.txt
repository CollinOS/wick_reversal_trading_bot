US TAX TREATMENT SUMMARY

Perpetual Futures Trades

Each position open to close is a taxable event.
Gains and losses are treated as capital gains.
Almost all trades will be short-term.
Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates.

Funding Payments

Positive funding payments are ordinary income.
Negative funding payments are ordinary expenses.
Funding payments should NOT be included in capital gains calculations.

Tax Reporting Responsibility

Hyperliquid does not issue Form 1099.
All activity must be self-reported.
