 build seperate program to detect markets that this strategy would be a good fit for

  Start Paper Trading

  python paper_trade.py --symbols DOGE-PERP --capital 1000

  This will:
  - Connect to real Hyperliquid price feeds
  - Generate signals from live 5-minute candles
  - Simulate trades (no real money)
  - Log everything to logs/ directory

  Run for 2+ weeks before considering live trading. Compare paper results to backtest:
  - Similar win rate? (~70%)
  - Similar trade frequency? (~1/day on DOGE)
  - Execution matching expectations?

  Next Steps After Paper Trading

  If paper trading validates the backtest:

  1. Live trading requires:
    - Hyperliquid wallet with funds
    - Replace SimulatedExecutor with HyperliquidExecutor
    - Start with smaller position sizes than backtested
  2. Consider adding symbols to increase opportunity:
    - Fetch more data: python fetch_binance_history.py --symbols DOGE-PERP PEPE-PERP FLOKI-PERP WIF-PERP
    - Backtest multi-symbol
    - Paper trade multi-symbol

  The strategy looks solid. Good edge, controlled risk, reasonable frequency.

  Paper trading:
  - Connects to real Hyperliquid price feeds
  - Generates real signals from live candles
  - Simulates fills at market prices
  - Logs everything to logs/ directory
  - Never submits actual orders
